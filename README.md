Background - Why do this?

I have been investing in the stock market over the last couple of years.  This year with the Covid 19 Pandemic - there has been bloodbath across the Indian stock market, however there are multiple stocks which have managed to prosper during this time.  My idea was to create a tool which would allow me to understand for the short term say between 7 days to 90 days how a particular stock would fare.  Such that I can make better informed judgment on whether to hold or sell the stock.  Also in the case of new information received on expected high performing stocks - be able to make a better than average market profits from the same.
